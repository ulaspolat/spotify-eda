## Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify 2023 Data

### Overview:
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Spotify data from the year 2023. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook named `main.ipynb` and relies on Python 3.11 and the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

### Files Included:
1. `spotify-2023.csv`: The data file containing Spotify data for the year 2023.
2. `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the analysis.

### Libraries Used:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (specifically `cosine_similarity`)

### Instructions to Reproduce:

1. **Download and Extract the Zip File:**
   - Download the zip file containing the project files.
   - Extract the contents to a directory of your choice.

2. **Create Anaconda Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create --name spotify-2023-env python=3.11
   conda activate spotify-2023-env
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/extracted/directory
   ```

5. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

   This command will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser. Navigate to the `main.ipynb` file and run each cell sequentially.

6. **View Visualizations:**
   The notebook contains code cells that generate visualizations. Ensure all cells are executed to reproduce the visualizations.

### Important Notes:
- Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.
- It is recommended to use an Anaconda environment to manage dependencies.
- Ensure all required packages are installed before running the notebook.
- If there are any issues or additional steps needed, they will be mentioned in the notebook.
